# 🎤 VoiceTAP.ai – Translate Analyze Predict

VoiceTAP.ai is an AI-powered voice processing platform that enables seamless, accurate, and accessible interaction through speech. Designed to address the limitations of traditional voice tools—such as low accuracy in noisy environments and poor accent handling—VoiceTAP.ai integrates **Speech-to-Text**, **Text-to-Speech**, **Gender Prediction**, and **Voice Analysis** into a unified, user-friendly system.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To develop a smart and inclusive voice interaction tool using Artificial Intelligence that:

- Accurately converts speech into text (Speech-to-Text)
- Generates natural-sounding audio from text (Text-to-Speech)
- Predicts speaker gender from voice
- Analyzes pitch and frequency for voice insights

### Key Features

- ✅ **Speech-to-Text Conversion** – Real-time transcription for dictation, notes, accessibility.
- 🔁 **Text-to-Speech Output** – Converts text into natural-sounding voice.
- 🧠 **Natural User Interaction** – More human-like interaction with machines.
- 👥 **User-Centric Design** – Ideal for educators, content creators, and differently-abled individuals.
- 🚀 **Boosts Productivity** – Enables fast and hands-free digital interaction.
